# Manny
## The Constable's Gift

Both Manny and Grosh found themselves frequently in the company of Tyr's Burden's Constable Horace Harper. Both understood that that was where they could be the most use and that the good Constable probably wanted to keep an eye on them and maybe get to know them a little. After all, unless someone came up with a plan to go find the orcs, it was likely that Force Grey would be around until they orcs returned.

Manny found Constable Horace to be refreshing. He was non-pretentious, spoke his mind clearly and succinctly about everything. Everyone knew what the rules of the town were and what to expect from law enforcement.

As far as law enforcement went, there was the Constable, his son and four other deputies who were little more than guys who needed a job and didn't want to or weren't any good at farming. When the orcs had come in the past, the deputies all stood their ground and made him proud, but Harper related that the townfolk themselves were probably a bigger deterrent than his men. They came out in numbers, with pitch-forks, shovels, old short swords and even pots and pans. They have been, just enough to keep the orcs out of the town itself.

For his part, Manny impressed the Constable, not because he was the most forthcoming or talkative of the bunch. Not because Manny had done anything at all to set the lawman at ease. In fact, it may have been just that he hadn't done anything to assuade any concerns Horace might have about himself or any of his *bizarre* team.

In Manny, the Constable related that he saw something of himself, when he was a younger man. When he wore a badge in the Morinden. He told Manny that he liked the work, he liked the idea of being a lawman, but didn't do so well with taking orders. He didn't last very long as part of their watch. And afterwards, he found himself *between careers, as much as on any path*, until they headed west. In truth, he confided (as he *no doubt*, told everyone), that he wasn't sure that he wanted this job at first. But he had known Tyson (the Mayor) and Maurice (Curate of Tyr) since they were all about waist high to Grosh. Maybe not even that tall. So when Tyson, who had stood as his second when he married Felicia and vis-versa, was adamant about this little project, he figured *he had to go* and he may as well have a job. Manny could tell instantly that this story is always followed by the same chuckle and is backed up by as much sincerity and commitment to Tyr's Burden as anyone else in the hamlet.

After the evening meal, few days before Manny and Force Grey went out after the orcs, Horace pulled Manny aside and took him to his office. The office was empty and on his desk was a package, carefully wrapped in a thick linen. Horace picked it up and handed it to Manny, it was heavy and felt dangerous.

Manny opened it revealing a strangely beautiful dagger and a pair of leather bracers.

Horace explained that he understood that when the time came, Manny and *his boys* would go out after the orcs and that he and *his boys* (with a slightly subtle emphasis on *boys*) would be staying back. He told Manny that he knew that one could never predict what that sort of thing was going to lead to, and he related, that there was a time that he knew what that life was like. And that these would probably suit Manny's lifestyle now, better than his own.

Wistfully, he told Manny that they were reliable and had seen him through more than his fair share of... *misadventures*. With only a slight tear in the corner of his eye, he explained how the bracers worked.

After he showed Manny how to stash the black dagger within the bracer and how to retrieve it to a hand of his own choosing, he nodded to the dagger. He told Manny that, he expected that a little of the magic that long since left him, that Manny would find in the blade. At least he said, "that's what *Dire Bob*, told me when he gave it to me. And damn, if he wasn't right, that *old pirate*." Horace again, shook off melancholoy and went on to explain the wonders of the dagger:

It wasn't long after, Manny and Force Grey set out, continuing their own *misadventure*...
